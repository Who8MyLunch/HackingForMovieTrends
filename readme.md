=====================

The objective of this effort is to demonstrate my data processing and analysis capabilities outside
of my traditional hyperspectral remote sensing work.  I have played in that arena for a long time
and picked up a good number of modeling and analysis skills.  This task is meant to be a quick
example of processing unfamiliar data using new tools and protocols. This is meant to be quick,
efficient, and have a clear punch line.
